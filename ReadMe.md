# Familia

## Setting Up

```Coming Soon```


## Permission Hierarchy

```Note: The bot first checks the UserID permissions and then checks their top Role permissions.```

**Permission Keys**
- `is_owner`: can run all the commands and features


## Running The Bot

Once you have everything set up and configured, you can open the root directory in your command promt and use the commands:

```shell
$ pip install -r Requirements.txt

$ python Main.py
```

This will install all the required libraries and launch the bot for you

```Note: You will need GIT installed for your bot to function, as the bot currently uses a branch of Nextcord for its slash commands.```
